# BBC Platform Programming Challenge - Ruby

## Installation

### Ruby
To check if you have already have Ruby installed go to your Terminal / Command Line.
This can be found easily on a Mac by pressing the cmd button and the space bar at the same time and typing "Terminal".

In your Terminal / Command Line run:

```
ruby -v
```

If that doesn't return the version we'll need to get you set up with Ruby. 

#### Installing Ruby on macOS with Homebrew
On OS X El Capitan, Yosemite, Mavericks, and macOS Sierra, Ruby 2.0 is included. OS X Mountain Lion, Lion, and Snow Leopard ship with Ruby 1.8.7.

Many people on OS X use Homebrew as a package manager. It is really easy to get a newer version of Ruby using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
$ brew install ruby
```

This should install the latest Ruby version.

[Install Ruby not on a macOS](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

### Bundler
Once you're set up on Ruby to make getting all our dependencies easy we're going to use Bundler.

Installing bundler is easy! In your Terminal run: 

```
$ gem install bundler
```
